RECYCLER VIEW
What it does
RecyclerView is designed to efficiently display a large number of data items.
It does this by reusing views that are no longer visible on the screen 

ListView only support linear scrolling when it comes to grid its difficult to perform it
and it does not have viewholder

Important Component
1. Adapter
bridge between recycler and data
Take data and bind it to view(arraylist)
has viewholder
handle itemcount

public ViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(@NonNull ViewGroup parent, int viewType)// its like factory for viewholder objects

 public void onBindViewHolder(@NonNull ViewHolder holder, int position)// id views are in this holder class
public int getItemCount() {
        return arrContacts.size();
    }
These above are important methods
